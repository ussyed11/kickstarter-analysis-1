# A Written Analysis of the Kickstarters 

## Data Analysis of Kickstarters to find trends based on theater outcomes by launch dates and goals by using Excel

### Provide visual data analysis such as pivot tables and charts for Lousie to plan her future fundraisers to be successful based on the theater outcomes by launch dates and goals

## Excel use: adding columns to get years, pivot table to create a line chart, countifs to get the total number of projects and percentages  based on a certain criteria. The challenge was to ensure that calculations were made on the right goal amount for each category and the function was inserted correctly in Excel.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Generate a pivot table by adding a years column on Dates Created to the KickStarters worksheet to filter outcomes of successful, failed and canceled campaigns based on the months. Then further filter the pivot table by theater category's successful outcomes in descending order. Below is a screen shot of the pivot table:

To further enhance data finding line chart was added:

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Use Excel's new sheet to get the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled plays based on the funding goal amount by using COUNTIFS function. Generate a line chart titled "Outcomes Based on Goal" to visualize the relationship between the goal-amount ranges on the x-axis and the percentage of successful, failed, or canceled projects on the y-axis:

### No challenges were encountered except for double checking functions errors due to typos.  


## Results
According to the Kickstarters Data analysis, Louise should start her fundraising campaigns in early May as there are 111 successful campaigns in May. She should also be aware that June, July and October all had roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched as well. If she plans to run and finish her campaign in four weeks timeframe, her campaign will have higher success rate by not running into the peak summer months where people plan other activities.

KickStarters analysis suggests that any fundraising goals set around $5000 or less have around 70%-75% chances of success.  If Louise set her goal around $4000 then there will be more than 70% chance to meet her goal successfully as the data shows that there were 388 successful goals that were set between 1000 to 4999. However, there will be around 50% chance of being successful if she sets her goals up to $20,000.

The one limitation that I see is missing the duration of the campaign to get an accurate picture based on the launch date. 
If we add the duration column to our KisckStarter worksheet and generate a pivot table with a chart that shows the durations of successful campaigns based on launched months.
